Clone this template https://github.com/angliukas/task-template.git

Change remote repository to yours

Rename it to correct one. The name must be in lower-case. The words of the name must be separetated by hyphens;

Delete Main class; You code will be here;

Rename package name;

Add junit-jupiter-engine Maven dependency into POM

Create only ONE Unit test. You will run your code from here instead of Main class;

Additional requirements:

The hotel structure:

First room (no capacity);

light is on/off

balcony door closed true/false

Second room (no capacity);

light is on/off

Kitchen:

is empty true/false

The examples what I expect from your code: 

Kithcen kitchen = new CherryTreelHotel()
kitchen.isOwenOn();
kitchen.lightIsOn();

ServiveRoom serviceRoom = new CherryTreelHotel()
serviceRoome.getAccess();
serviceRoome.lightIsOn();
